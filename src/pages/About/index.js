      Japanese domestic market (JDM) refers to Japan's home market for vehicles.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Japanese domestic market vehicles may differ greatly from the cars that Japanese
      manufacturers build for export and vehicles derived from the same platforms built
      in other countries. The Japanese car owner looks more toward innovation than
      long-term ownership which forces Japanese carmakers to refine new technologies
      and designs first in domestic vehicles. For instance, the 2003 Honda Inspire
      featured the first application of Honda's Variable Cylinder Management. However,
      the 2003 Honda Accord V6, which was the same basic vehicle, primarily intended
      for the North American market, did not feature VCM, which had a poor reputation
      after Cadillac's attempt in the 1980s with the V8-6-4 engine. VCM was
      successfully introduced to the Accord V6 in its redesign for 2008.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      In 1988, JDM cars were limited by voluntary self-restraints among manufacturers
      to 280 horsepower (PS) (276 hp) and a top speed of 180 km/h (111.8 mph),
      limits imposed by the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association (JAMA) for safety.
      The horsepower limit was lifted in 2004 but the speed limit of 180 km/h (111.8 mph) remains.

      This are just some facts that may or may not be in the quiz I putted together, I hope
      you will have fun playing it and learn something about JDM :)
